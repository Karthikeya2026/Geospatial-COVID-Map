# Geospatial-COVID-Map
Visualising COVID-19 case data on a world map using Python and GeoPandas
# 🌍 Geospatial COVID-19 Map Project

This project visualises COVID-19 case data across countries using Python and GeoPandas.  
The goal is to demonstrate geospatial data analysis and visualisation for real-world public health data.

## 📊 Project Overview

- ✅ Merged global country shapefiles with COVID-19 case data
- ✅ Created a choropleth map to show the distribution of COVID-19 cases
- ✅ Explored spatial joins and visualisation techniques
- ✅ Tools used: Python, Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib
